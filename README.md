# ML4G - Project 2

All the code relevant for the submission is contained in the file `main.ipynb.`.

Please note that the project uses Astral's [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package and project manager. Run `uv sync` to get the correct Python and packages versions. In case you don't want to (or can't) install uv, we've also included a simple `requirements.txt`. We still recommend to use uv as we don't guarantee that pip/conda will work and produce the same results.
